    #####
    > 3. How many table entries would be required if only the current percept was used to select and action rather than the percept history?  
    #####  If there are n possible percepts and m possible actions, then the number of table entries required would be n * m. so with only the current precept and the 4 actions, this whould be 4 table entries
    > 4. How many table entries are required for an agent lifetime of T steps?
