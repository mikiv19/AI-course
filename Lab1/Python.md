# Python version
We will be working with 
> Python 3.12

The reason for this is two-fold:
- Python 3.11 introduced some large performance improvements, which is appreciated.
Python 3.12 further iterated on this.

- Secondly 3.12 has good support for type hinting, which is a good practice to get into.


Additionally, in modern Python we will be utilizing f-strings, which were introduced in Python 3.6.
This way of formatting strings is much more readable and easier to use than the old way of doing it.


If you are using an older version of Python, you might run into some issues with the code especially the type hinting.

## Type hinting
Type hinting in Python is optional, but it is highly recommended. 
We will provide fully type hinted code for you, and you will be doing yourself 
(and us if you need help) a favor by continuing to build on it.
